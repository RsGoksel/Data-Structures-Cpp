Foundations of Data Structures in C++: Descriptions and Illustrations


In C++, a struct is a composite data type that allows you to group variables of different data types under a single name.

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science that consists of a sequence of elements, each of which contains a value (or data) and a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence.

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science that consists of a sequence of elements, each of which contains a value (or data) and a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence.

The insertion method in a linked list refers to the process of adding a new element (node) into the list at a specific position.

Binary trees on the other hand, is a hierarchical data structure in computer science that consists of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are widely used in computer science and programming for various purposes due to their properties and versatility

Linked lists come in various forms, such as singly linked lists (where each node points to the next node), doubly linked lists (where each node has references to both the next and previous nodes), and circular linked lists (where the last node points back to the first node).

Linked lists are used in a wide range of applications, including implementing stacks, queues, and other data structures, as well as in various algorithms and programming problems.
